# Bulk Database Update (Python)

## Overview
In my current role there are situations where a client or an internal stakeholder will ask us to make thousands of updates to a database table at once. These updates are usually sent to us in the form of a csv or txt file containing the update statements (similar to the output from my [SQL-Factory](https://github.com/isomericmagic/SQL-Factory) code) and we will then need to run the update statements in the corresponding MySQL database. The SQL database is usually on an AWS instance that we are accessing through a terminal, so pasting the updates into a GUI isn't an option and trying to run them all individually would take too long which is why I made this script, which connects to the database and then runs each update statement in the csv file.
